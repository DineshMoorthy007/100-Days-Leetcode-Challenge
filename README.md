# 🚀 100 Days LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 100-day LeetCode challenge! This repository documents my journey of solving one LeetCode problem every day for 100 consecutive days.

## 📋 Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to:
- Solve at least one LeetCode problem daily for 100 days
- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking
- Build consistency and discipline in coding practice
- Document solutions and learnings for future reference

## 📜 Rules

1. **Daily Commitment**: Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day
2. **Documentation**: Each solution should include:
   - Problem description and link
   - Approach and thought process
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Clean, well-commented code
3. **No Skipping**: If a day is missed, the challenge restarts
4. **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on understanding rather than just completing problems
5. **Review**: Revisit and optimize solutions when possible

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
100-Days-Leetcode-Challenge/
├── Day-01/          # Day 1 solutions
├── Day-02/          # Day 2 solutions
├── Day-03/          # Day 3 solutions
...
├── Day-99/          # Day 99 solutions
├── Day-100/         # Day 100 solutions
└── README.md        # This file
```

Each day's folder will contain (once solutions are added):
- Solution file(s) in your preferred language(s)
- README.md with problem details and explanation
